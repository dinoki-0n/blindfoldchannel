  <h2 class="ha2">Lore</h2>
  <p>He is a person originally from Indonesia, living with us which is in Mexico, he is simply a "Country Human" but with some modifications to adapt to my life or the stories I have read on the internet. Inkko is a kind and very hard-working person, he likes to study and sometimes he draws things with watercolors and does his housework but however he hides his face with a paper stuck all over his face since in his past he had to go through a strange eye infection, his eyes were very red at this time he could not see so well but the days passed and his eyes have improved and Inkko can see well, but he had an insecurity in his face because his face looked supposedly ugly and that is why he decided to cover his face with a white paper with a little face that changed expression (basically it was a magic paper), Inkko hated his face and a lot but do not worry, that hommie is very good and he revealed his face in front of a speech, he felt good doing it.</p>
