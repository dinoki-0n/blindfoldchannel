  <h2 class="ha2">Lore</h2>
  <p>In the vast digital world, where stick figures and real people coexisted, there were two figures who stood out for their charisma and ability to generate strong reactions: Xori and Xiaro, a YouTuber whose name was almost forbidden to mention. Both figures, seemingly similar, hid a turbulent past that had turned their relationship into a bitterly public rivalry but with private details that very few knew. Xori, known for her vlogs about travel and adventures on Earth, had gained an audience that valued her authentic and fun content. Her channel was a refuge for those who wanted to disconnect from the stresses of everyday life. However, the conflict began when, one day, an emerging YouTuber began to gain popularity with videos full of absurd humor and extreme social criticism. This YouTuber, known as Xiaro, was not only bold, but also problematic. Her videos on sensitive topics, in stick figure format like Xori, generated controversy. Her scathing style and inappropriate content made her famous, but also brought her enemies.</p>
