<p class="quot">Dorian Gray is a boy who helps Cleiver get ahead, since he met him, he never stops identifying with him since he had a story almost similar to Cleiver, so he supports Cleiver at all times so that he grows and gets out of the trauma once and for all. Dorian Gray is an optimistic boy and each time he improves in his mind and body so that he is safe from the dangers out there, this boy is kind and helps others, drawing is his hobby, but helping people get out of trauma is his passion, since he wants people to have a smile for people and for everyone.</p>
