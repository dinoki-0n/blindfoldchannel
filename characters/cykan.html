<p class="quot">Well, as I said, Fis- I mean... Cykan is a man with a blue patch in the left eye, he searches the meaning of life, who is dedicated to researching history, and how this world is every time more incredulous and evil of the universe, he wants to search to stop the violence and crime, and that people feel inner peace, he likes fishing but people calls him "fishy" and he doesn't like it (due to a person is called "fishy" and he looks similar to him, and looks cringe with this name) but it doesn't matter, just he wants to fulfill the mission of the day.</p>

  <h2 class="ha2">Lore</h2>
  <p>Cykan is a Stickman who likes to fish and he likes to explore the land around him. I'll tell you his story, Cykan was passionate about being a fisherman because he was a big fan of fish and the sea, so he got into a boat for the first time and started fishing, for Cykan, it was the best experience of his entire life. Until one day, Cykan went to explore a very very far away forest, he found amazing animals, beautiful and rare plants, insects everywhere, and very tall trees that he looked up, until an unknown beast arrived that decided to attack Cykan, without deciding Cykan ran away from the forest until the unknown beast caught up with him and scratched Cykan's right eye (reason why he has an eye patch), causing him intense pain but finally he got rid of that beast and left this forest.</p>
