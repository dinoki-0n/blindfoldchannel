  <h2 class="ha2">Lore</h2>
  <p>It was Cleiver's first day of high school and he was excited to see that school...
    
    Cleiver presented himself in front of his classmates and the teacher, he was happy...
    
    Until some of his classmates Cleiver looked strange because his eyes were a very different color, and in addition to that it was changed...
    
    Until now Cleiver could not understand what was happening, until he realized that they were making fun of something and he did not know what it was.
    
    Nothing happened to him on this day, but as the days went by his classmates on the recess saw cleiver in a bad way and made fun of Cleiver's eye color, they called him "3D glasses" or "chameleon" and they used bad words all the time (and they even beat him up), now Cleiver He already realized that they made fun of him (and as he was coy and sensitive, He left alone in his classroom crying), He didn't know why he was being bullied by his classmates until he heard his name "3D glasses" that's where he realized that Cleiver's eyes were the mockery of his classmates...</p>
