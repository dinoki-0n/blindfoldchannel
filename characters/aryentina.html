<p class="quot">He's Argentina (called incorrectly Aryentina) he haves a sun mask and a turquoise skin. He's a person who play sports (like football) and likes the skating and cycling to be active, he doesn't like to take off his mask, as all my mask characters, his mask hides a secret about his life, plus my character is my Avatar/Mascot what I'm using currently. My Character basically is my OCsona !</p>

  <h2 class="ha2">Lore</h2>
  <p>Aryentina is a person who likes to practice sports and ride a bike, he had such a tremendous ability on the bike that other people were amazed by his incredible strength. However, nothing is known about him at all but he always wears a mask/helmet of a little sun that changes the expressions of his eyes when he is happy or when he is sad. Aryentina was enjoying the beautiful scenery on his bike until he fell victim to a strange beast (like Cykan) that hurt one of his eyes, and Aryentina didn't want anyone to know about it, so Aryentina wanted to cover his face (especially his eyes) so he wore a cap to cover his eyes but it still showed a little bit of his face so a few months later he wore a sun, since he was from argentina and the sun was on his flag, so he made the sun mask and finally the mask covered his whole head.</p>
