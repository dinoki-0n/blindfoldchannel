  <h2 class="ha2">Lore</h2>
  <p>The story begins with a boy who simply composes music (I say it again), he is influenced by cleiver and he is basically a composer not so successful but not bad either, since he was little he was interested in music and the message it conveyed, so he learned some tones, tuned some instruments and above all have his name unique in the world. He is a runner and keeps his body healthy and balanced, he exercises in his free time and shares with his followers his ways of having an attractive body and good health, he proves it with his leather jacket and his attractive black face mask. Hacha is a person who, as I mentioned before, makes music and seeks complete control of it, he does not have it very mastered yet, let's wait for that man to learn well and be friendly to people and his mind.</p>
